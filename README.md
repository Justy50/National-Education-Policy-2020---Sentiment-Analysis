# National-Education-Policy-2020---Sentiment-Analysis
The main idea behind this project is to identify tweets positive/neutral/negative made on NEP 2020.
The policy of NEP was introduced recently in 2020 & many Indian citizens including nationalists, politicians & prestige institutions tweeted their views/opinions on the subject.
The goal was to indentify how many of those tweets were positive (acknowledging governments decision) / negative (not liking the new policy) / neutral.
Using NLP - sentinmental analysis, I built a model to determine the end goal.
